# Chris Womack for Grow Therapy

Hi!

Run any of the following to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Run this command for the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Thank you for your consideration. I've really enjoyed working on this, compliments to the design team!
